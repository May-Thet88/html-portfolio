<h1>The Best Movie According to May Thet</h1>

<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Me before you</h3>
 <p>A romantic movie that will make you end up crying buckets. That is the only movie that made me preoccupied with the sad ending.
  I was really choked up.</p> 
  <h3>2. Marry My husband</h3>
 <p> Marry my husband is a K-drama, which genre is not my cup of tea. Inspite of a revenge movie, it is also a great film that is capable of catching my attention. <br /> 
  A pratagonist go back time in ten years and work very hard to pay her husband and best friend back for what they've done.</p>
  <h3>3.Mean Girls</h3>
  <p> I'm not in the habit of re-watching movies that I've ever watched. But this one that features teenager's lives is beyond amazing. 
  Hghly recommend if you're finding a feel-good movie.</p>
